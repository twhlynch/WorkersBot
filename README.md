# WorkersBot

An easy way to set up an application commands bot for Discord using CloudFlare Workers.

## Setup

### Creating a bot

Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click `New Application`. Enter a name, check agree, and click `Create`.

Scroll down to APPLICATION ID and click `Copy` (Save this for later).

Scroll down to PUBLIC KEY and click `Copy` (Save this for later).

Open the left menu and click `Bot`. Click `RESET TOKEN`, `Yes do it!`, and then `Copy` under TOKEN (Save this for later).

### Inviting the bot

Open the left menu and click `Installation`.

Check `Guild Install`, change Install Link to `Discord Provided Link`, click `Copy`, and click `Save Changes`.

The link will look similar to `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1337065840757382170`. Open the link in your browser and select the server you want to add the bot to.

### Creating a worker

Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/ and click `Workers & Pages` in the left menu.

Copy `Account ID` from the right and save it for later.

Click `Create application`, `Create Worker`, name it "WorkersBot" (or change that and change it in wrangler.toml as well), and then `Deploy`.

Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile and click `API Tokens`.

Click `Create Token`, `Use Template` next to Edit Cloudflare Workers.

At Account Resources select your account.

At Zone Resources select All Zones.

Click `Continue To Summary`, `Create Token`, and `Copy`. (Save this for later).
